Things I would like to finish before the mod is ready for distribution.
Symbol * means DONE

1. Implement World Generation For The Ore
2. Increase End Dragon's Health To 500+ Hearts Somehow (1,000 health points) (1hp = 0.5 hearts)
3. Add Dangers to The End Fight (such as custom mobs or even extra mobs like a warden)
4. Add a Boot Effect To Turn Lava Into A More Tolerable Block, Such as Magma, Or Even Obsidian.
5. Edit the eight ball to have custom conditions, such as spawning mobs, giving items, etc.
