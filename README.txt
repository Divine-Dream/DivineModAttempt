==Introduction==

Divine Dream's first ever mod.
I've never attempted at creating a mod before, just testing things out and getting
a feel for the basics.

==The Mod==

"divinemod" was just the name I decided to give it when I didn't know I'd be trying to actually
make it into something.
This mod adds in new ore called "zircon" along with an entirely new SET of armor and tools.
There are custom effects within this mod involving the tools and the armor alike.
For simplicity of the mod, all recipes will be based around zircon in some way.

==Divine Dream==

My name is Brock.

My Discord is: Divine Dream#0001

If this mod does well, I fully intend on making another.
For any suggestions message me on discord and the ideas that stick out most will most
likely end up in a mod.

==Updates==
All updates to the mod can be found on my github:
https://github.com/Divine-Dream

Until I figure out more about github and jar files and shit, all updates to this mod
will be sent out via discord.
